SASS/SCSS Project

What is Sass?:

	Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
	Sass is an extension to CSS
	Sass is a CSS pre-processor
	Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
	Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
	Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
	Sass is free to download and use


Why Use Sass?:

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.



How Does Sass Work?:

A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.



Sass File Type:

Sass files has the ".scss" file extension.
